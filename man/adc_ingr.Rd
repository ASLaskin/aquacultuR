\title{ADC of a feed ingredient (ADCingr)}
\usage{
adc_ingr(adc_test, adc_ref, nut_ref, nut_ingr, incl_ingr)
}
\arguments{
\item{adc_test}{a numeric value in the interval [0,1] that represents the
Apparent Digestibility Coefficient (ADC) of the diet that contains the
ingredient to be tested.}

\item{adc_ref}{a numeric value in the interval [0,1] that represents the
Apparent Digestibility Coefficient (ADC) of the reference diet without the
ingredient to be tested.}

\item{nut_ref}{a numeric value in the interval [0,1] that represents the
inclusion rate of the nutrient in the reference diet.}

\item{nut_ingr}{a numeric value in the interval [0,1] that represents the
inclusion rate of the nutrient in the test diet for which the Apparent
Digestibility Coefficient (ADC) of the nutrient in the ingredient will be
calculated.}

\item{incl_ingr}{a numeric value in the interval [0,1] that represents the
inclusion rate of the ingredient in the test diet for which the Apparent
Digestibility Coefficient (ADC) of the nutrient in an ingredient will be
calculated.}
}
\value{
returns a single numeric value which is the relative ADC for the
diet. If the value is not within the interval [0,1], an additional warning
is returned.
}
\description{
Function to calculate the Apparent Digestibility Coefficient of a nutrient 
contained in a feed ingredient of a compound diet.
}
\note{
The calculation of the ADCingr is based on the equation proposed by Bureau
and Hua (2006).
