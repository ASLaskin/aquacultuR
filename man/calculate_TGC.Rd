TGC
}
\description{
Function to calculate the Thermal Growth Coefficient (TGC).
}
\usage{
calculate_TGC(initWeight, finalWeight, duration, temp)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{initWeight}{
  a numeric value that is providing the initial weight in grams.
  }
  \item{finalWeight}{
  a numeric value that is providing the final weight in grams.
  }
  \item{duration}{
  a numeric value that is providing the duration of the experiment in days.
  }
  \item{temp}{
  a numeric value that is providing the average temperature during the experiment in degrees Celsius.
  }
}
\details{
The TGC is an alternative growth metric for fishes, describing the increase in bodyweight over a period of time. It is suitable for poikilothermic animals due to its standardisation for temperature. It should, however, be taken into account, that the temperature during the experiment should remain within the optimum range.
}
\value{
Returns a numeric value that is the TGC.
