\description{
Calculates the Absolute Growth %% ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of
what the function does. ~~
}
\details{
A function that calculates the Absolute Growth (AG), also denoted as
Absolute Weight Gain (AWG) based on the Initial Body weight (IBW;
initWeight) in gram (g) and the Final Body Weight (FBW; finalWeight)
in gram (g).
}
\note{
The AG, also termed Absolute Weight Gain (AWG), is the weight that was
gained within the duration of a growth trial. It does by default not
distinguish between weight gain in form of dry matter or water.

AG = FBW - IBW

The IBW is subtracted from the FBW.
