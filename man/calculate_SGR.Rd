\title{Function to calculate the Specific Growth Rate}
\usage{
calculate_SGR(initWeight, finalWeight, duration)
}
\arguments{
\item{initWeight}{numeric value that is providing the initial weight in
grams.}

\item{finalWeight}{numeric value that is providing the final weight in
grams.}

\item{duration}{numeric value that is providing the duration of the
experiment in days.}
}
\value{
Returns the SGR as percentage value. %% ~Describe the value returned
%% If it is a LIST, use %% \item{comp1 }{Description of 'comp1'} %%
\item{comp2 }{Description of 'comp2'} %% ...
}
\description{
A function that calculates the Specific Growth Rate (SGR) based on
the Initial Body weight (IBW; initWeight) in gram (g), the Final Body
Weight (FBW; finalWeight) in gram (g) and the duration of the trial
(duration) in days (d).
}
\note{
The SGR is a growth metric for fishes, describing the increase in bodyweight
over a period of time.

SGR = (ln(FBW[g]) - ln(IBW[g])) / t[d] *100

The natural logarithm of the initial body weight is subtracted from
the natural logarithm of the final body weight. The term is then
divided by the trial duration and multiplied by 100 to convert into a
percentage.
